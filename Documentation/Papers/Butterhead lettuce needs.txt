Butterhead lettuce needs: 
(PAPER REFERENCE: PAPER_01)
 - prefered air temperature: 16 - 18°C |  > 24°C bolting and poor growing, < 7°C too low
 - water temperature between 7 - 18°C
 - nitrogent rich soil ?
 - pH between 6.0 and 6.8
 - nutrients: N, K+, Mg2+ and Ca 2+

 - stages of the plant: 	
	0. Sowing: 5 to 10 days
	1. Lettuce seed germination: soil: 16 - 21°C, air: 20 - 24°C || pH: 6.0 - 7.5 || 7 - 20 days
	2. Seedling (first true leaves):
	3. Head development: 
	4. Harvesting
	5. Flowering and seeding

 - nutrient solution: Ca(NO3)2, KNO3, NH4NO3, MgSO4, 7H2O, KH2PO4
			    143 - NO3-N, 16 - NH4N, 46 - P, 180 - K+, 30 - Ca2+, 30 Mg2+, 39 - S
			    with Electric conductivity of 1.1 dS/m
  	» renewed weekly
 - N intake increasis in the first 50 days (from seedling), P, K , Ca, Mg increased as well due to high relative growth rate
 - plants grown in low light conditions need a higher electrical conductivity nutrient solution
